           Areeb: We chose a simple layout with uvm's color palatte to keep a clean but familiar look. The biggest problem I had was working with git as
            it didnt let us go about with a lot of changes. Most of the coding itself went smoothly, give or take a few inconsistenceies
            in the html files that had me coding a few extra lines here and there. </p>
        <p> Yangyi: After we discuss who does which pages, we cost lots of time to decide how each different page
            looks like one website. Since different people do different pages, we decide to use the same color and style. After that. The hard problem I met is 
            in the sponsor form page. Because I add some padding to the form, when I change this page to ipad or phones, the screen is not enough to hold  it and half
            of the form becomes green which is the background color. I change the background color to 
            white to solve this problem. However, this page becomes a lot of blank so I change the max width to 75% for the form.
